Figgy is a cloud native, opensource, and serverless framework designed to bring
simplicity, security, and resilience to application config management. It's built on AWS ParameterStore and 
leverages native AWS constructs such as AWS IAM, KMS, DynamoDB, and Lambda to ensure a simple 
integration with your environment. Figgy does not overlap with any existing AWS services, instead it builds on them, 
providing added functionality and an improved user experience.
