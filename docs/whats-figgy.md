Figgy is an cloud native, serverless, open-source framework that simplifies and accelerates your development workflow 
by protecting you from common mistakes that lead to security breaches, failed deployments, lost data, or application downtime. 
Figgy is built on AWS ParameterStore and leverages native AWS constructs such as AWS IAM, KMS, DynamoDB, and Lambda to ensure a simple 
integration with your environment. Figgy does not overlap with any existing AWS services, instead it builds on them, 
providing added functionality and an improved user experience.

Figgy is a management framework for configurations stored in AWS ParameterStore. It helps your teams safely manage
the SSM keyspace, preventing misconfigured deployments and supporting least-privilege access. Figgy natively works with
multiple AWS accounts and maintains a global audit log, which gives operators the ability to do global

## Why Figgy?


#### Simple & secure config and secret management
As your cloud footprint grows, so do the configurations you need to manage your applications. 
Figgy is a framework for simple, secure, and resilient config management in AWS. The best part? No new servers to 
deploy, upgrade, and patch. No complex software to learn. Follow Figgy’s laid-out path for config management. 
It’s AWS native, compatible with all AWS services, and follows AWS best practices. Let Figgy help you get it right from the start.

#### Prevent downtime due to config mismanagement
Figgy provides a suite of utilities that link your code to your configs. 
Detect and remedy misconfigurations before deployment rather than scrambling after the alarm bells are going off.

---
#### Let the secret owners own the secrets
Figgy establishes a framework for teams of secret owners to securely track, manage, and rotate their secrets in their 
team’s secure space. From that space they can share secrets directly with the applications that need them -- 
without going through a middle-man. No more LastPass, one-time urls, secrets sent over Slack, email, encrypted files, 
or any of those annoying secret management hoops. In a few weeks, when your coworker “Bill” finds new employment, 
don’t ask yourself, “What secrets passed through Bill that we need to rotate now?”

---
#### Easily manage and maintain least privilege
Figgy makes it easy to give both users and applications, the exact amount of access they need and nothing more. Figgy's 
primary features are designed to make it easy to scalably maintain and enforce least privilege. By following Figgy best
practices you can easily maintain appropriate access for users and services while keeping your IAM policies short and sweet.

---
#### Maximum visibility & resiliency
Figgy maintains a history of every event that has ever occurred in your configuration store since the day you 
installed Figgy. Know what happened, where, when, and by who. Then, roll back any configuration, 
or hierarchy of configurations, to any point-in-time in the past, to the second.

#### A tool everyone can get behind
Perhaps the  question isn't "Why Figgy", it's "Why not?". Figgy is free, opensource, and principally designed with a 
focus on the ideal user experience regardless if you're a developer, a member of the DevOps or Security teams, 
a database administrator, or someone else.
