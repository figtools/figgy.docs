# What's Figgy?

Tired of managing hundreds or thousands of configurations as your microservice footprint scales? Tired of config files, 
environment variables, and constantly crashing containers due to configuration mismanagement? There's a better way.

Figgy is configuration management framework designed to bring developers, DevOps engineers, and secret owners together 
around an ecosystem designed for simple and secure configuration and secret management. Figgy has features designed 
around each user story, so there's a little bit for everyone to appreciate.

*The principal goals of Figgy are:*

- Simplify and secure application configuration management
- Prevent bugs due to configuration mismanagement
- Limit the exposure of secrets to ONLY secret owners and the applications that require them.
- Practice configuration 'GitOps' without _actually_ storing your configurations in Git. 
- Make users happy :smile:

Depending on who you are, your Figgy Docs experience may differ. If your organization already uses's Figgy and you're looking
to install the CLI and get started, then I recommend you skip over to [Install](/getting-started/install/)
then browse one of the [User Guides](/user-guides/dev/)
