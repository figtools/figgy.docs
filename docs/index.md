# What's Figgy?

Figgy is an **_opensource_** serverless application config framework designed to bring simplicity, security, and resilience to 
application config management. Figgy is built on top of AWS ParameterStore and leverages native AWS constructs such as AWS IAM, 
KMS, DynamoDB, and Lambda to ensure a simple and elegant integration with your AWS environment.

## Why Figgy?
Tired of managing hundreds or thousands of configurations as your microservice footprint scales? Tired of config files, 
environment variables, and constantly crashing containers due to configuration mismanagement? There's a better way.

#### Simple & secure config and secret management
As your cloud footprint grows, so do the configurations you need to manage your applications. 
Figgy is a framework for simple, secure, and resilient config management in AWS. The best part? No new servers to 
deploy, upgrade, and patch. No complex software to learn. Follow Figgy’s laid-out path for config management. 
It’s AWS native, compatible with all AWS services, and follows AWS best practices. Let Figgy help you get it right from the start.

#### Prevent downtime due to config mismanagement
Figgy provides a suite of utilities that link your code to your configs. 
Detect and remedy misconfigurations before deployment rather than scrambling after the alarm bells are going off.

---
#### Let the secret owners own the secrets
Figgy establishes a framework for teams of secret owners to securely track, manage, and rotate their secrets in their 
team’s secure space. From that space they can share secrets directly with the applications that need them -- 
without going through a middle-man. No more lastpass, one-time urls, secrets sent over Slack, email, encrypted files, 
or any of those annoying secret management hoops. In a few weeks, when your coworker “Bill” finds new employment, 
don’t ask yourself, “What secrets passed through Bill that we need to rotate now?”

---
#### Maximum visiblity & resiliency
Figgy maintains a history of every event that has ever occurred in your configuration store since the day you 
installed Figgy. Know what happened, where, when, and by who. Then, roll back any configuration, 
or hierarchy of configurations, to any point-in-time in the past, to the second.

#### A tool everyone can get behind
Perhaps the  question isn't "Why Figgy", it's "Why not?". Figgy is free, opensource, and principally designed with a focus on 
ensuring the ideal user experience regardless if you're a developer, a member of the DevOps or Security teams, 
a database administrator, or a hybrid of all of the above.
