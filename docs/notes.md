Simple, declarative, configuration & secret management that just works
AWS native configuration & secret management.


Microservices are great, but your growing service footprint means configuration management just got a lot harder. Figgy is for teams looking to embrace modern cloud-native application design but avoid the complexity and management burden in-house or 3rd party tools. 





## What's Figgy?


Figgy simplifies and accelerates your development workflow by protecting you from common mistakes that lead to security breaches, 
failed deployments, lost data, or application downtime.

Figgy is a cloud native, opensource, and serverless application config framework designed to bring
simplicity, security, and resilience to application config management. It's built on AWS ParameterStore and 
leverages native AWS constructs such as AWS IAM, KMS, DynamoDB, and Lambda to ensure a simple 
integration with your environment. Figgy does not overlap with any existing AWS services, instead it builds on them, 
providing added functionality and an improved user experience.


## **Why Figgy?**

Tired of managing hundreds or thousands of configurations as your microservice footprint scales? Feeling overwhelmed 
by config files, environment variables, sprawling application secrets, or constantly crashing containers due to missing
configurations? Ever been too afraid to delete a configuration because you weren't sure if, or what, was still using it?
There's a better way, the Figgy way!

## Why Figgy?

> **Prevent downtime due to config mismanagement**

Figgy makes it possible to **bind your code directly to configurations**. Easily break builds if configs 
are missing and application deployments are destined to fail.


> **Control user access like a champ**

Figgy makes it easy to set up and control access across all of your AWS environments and configuration namespaces. Consider
your role types and use cases, map them up in a simple config file, and let Figgy do the rest. With Figgy you can audit all user activity and 
configuration changes over time, enabling you to roll back any config, or group of configurations, to any point-in-time in the past.

> **Deep AWS integrations with no servers**

Figgy Cloud deploys directly into your AWS environment. There are no servers to patch or maintain, no overlap
of existing AWS functionality, and no dependency on 3rd parties.

> **Integrate with your SSO provider, abandon long-lived AWS Keys for good**

Figgy supports SAML based SSO integrations with multi-factor authentication. Simplify AWS access control with Figgy!

> **Feature rich CLI to speed-up your development workflow.**
