## Upgrade

Command:

    $   figgy --upgrade
        
Upgrades the user's version of `figgy` to the latest version. 

Manual and Homebrew installs of figgy support automatic upgrades. It only takes a second to download and set-up the latest
version of the FiggyCLI with `figgy --upgrade`. 

We recommend manual or Homebrew figgy installations for this reason.
