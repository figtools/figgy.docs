## Promote


Select a single value, or hierarchy of values in ParameterStore to promote to the next environment (i.e. from DEV to QA). 
Promote will only promote values that are not configured through replication. You will be prompted to promote 
each value so can eaisly omit promotion of any values you wish to avoid.

You can only promote values you have access to both retrieve and decrypt.
