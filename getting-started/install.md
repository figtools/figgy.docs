# Installation
Installing Figgy is _easy_.

*MacOs*

    $    brew install mancej/figgy/figgy
        
*Windows, Linux, or Mac* (requires Python 3)

    $    pip3 install figgy-cli



The homebrew installation is a little slow because it requires installing a brand new virtual environment and all dependencies. 
I hope to make this experience better in the future.
