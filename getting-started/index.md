## Getting Started

Got 15 minutes or less? I can't save you on car insurance, but you can complete our quick-and-easy [Figgy Demo & Walkthrough](https://github.com/figtools/figgy.python-reference). 

#### Learn these core Figgy concepts:
- Use the Figgy CLI to log in and swap between up to 5 different AWS Accounts.

- Impersonate a "Secret Owner" and store some super-secret credentials. 

- Run a local Docker (or non-docker) application and see how Figgy's libraries will infer your 
configuration dependencies straight from your source code!

- Synchronize your local code's config state with remote configurations stored in AWS.

- Promote your remote configs from lower environments to higher environments to simulate rolling out your application!

- And so much more! It's all free. Experiment in a sandbox spanning FIVE AWS accounts!

#### Done?
